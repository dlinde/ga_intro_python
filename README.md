# ga_intro_python

### In this repo you'll find notebooks accompanying my GA intro python presentation, one without and another with solutions. The notebooks will render in the browser or can be downloaded and opened using jupyter. To do the latter, save the notebook to a directory and navigate to that directory after you've launched jupyter.
